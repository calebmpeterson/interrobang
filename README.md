Hosted accounts are available at [https://interrobang.online](https://interrobang.online).

## Self-hosted

**Interrobang is open core**.

My primary goal in choosing this route is to enable you to see what I do with your search queries üßê

This means it is possible to host your own instance. [Read more about why I've chosen this approach](https://interrobang.online/about/open-source-policy/).

There will be some infrastructure to setup ü§ì

## Privacy Policy

**TL;DR Your queries are never tracked.**

Pageview, !bang (_not query_), and user ID are tracked with Google
Analytics to better understand usage and guide future improvements.

For more information, please read the [Interrobang Privacy Policy](https://interrobang.online/about/privacy-policy/). It's less than a page :)
